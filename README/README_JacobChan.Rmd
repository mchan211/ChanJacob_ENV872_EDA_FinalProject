## Summary

> The data within this repository includes a shapefile to conduct any spatial analysis, a raw data file which includes public health and population distribution data per NC county, and a data file which includes the spatial locations of hog farms within NC. The purpose of this repository is to examine if there are higher levels of health challenges and disparities within NC with high concentrations of hog farms compared to other NC counties, as well as observe any racial and economic inequities within communities where hog farms are mainly located. We will compare racial, health, etc. distributions within North Carolina compared to counties with the highest concentration of hog farms.

## Metadata

### Raw Folder
> We wrangled the original County Health Data 2021.xlsx into County Health Data 2021.csv file for easier access with manipulating the dataset.The County Health Data 2021.csv file has 62 rows and 109 columns. The class of all the columns is a factor. The dataframe contains descriptions for each row (Bold.Indicator.Name.Text) in the Indicator.Descriptor.Text and Source.Label columns. 

```{r raw info, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

countyraw <- read.csv("../ChanJacob_ENV872_EDA_FinalProject/Data/Raw/County Health Data 2021.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

summary(countyraw)
dim(countyraw)
class(countyraw)

```


### Processed
> The projectNCcounties_HealthData.csv file is our wrangled dataframe in which we conducted analysis on. We wrangled all the columns with filtered into our processed dataset into the numerical class. 

```{r processed info, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
countyhealth <- read.csv("../ChanJacob_ENV872_EDA_FinalProject/Data/Processed/projectNCcounties_HealthData.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

summary(countyhealth)

dim(countyhealth)

### Spatial

> For the spatial analysis component of our project, we used the Cartographic Boundary shapefile (cb_2018_us_county_20m.shp) to map North Carolina and its counties. The cartographic boundary files are simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the Census Bureauâ€™s MAF/TIGER geographic database. These boundary files are specifically designed for small scale thematic mapping. We used 2018 data year shapefile with a resolution level of 20m. The shapefile contains information regarding geographic features of all US states. For our project, we were only interested in the counties located in North Carolina, hence, we filtered the shapefile to provide geographic information of the counties located in North Carolina. The attributes present in the county shapefile are the geographic coordinates, area of land and water, state and county FIPS codes, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) codes, GEOIDs, names of the counties and legal/statistical area description codes.

> The Hog_Farm_Locations_NC.csv file contains locations of Hog Farms present in North Carolina. The coordinates of Hog Farm Locations were obtained from Google Maps. Phantom Buster - a web application used for extracting data from websites was used to extract coordinates of Hog Farms from Google Maps. The coordinates were converted to a spatial features dataset in order to map them with the counties dataset. 

```{r}
HogFarm_Locations <- read.csv("../ChanJacob_ENV872_EDA_FinalProject/Data/Spatial/Hog_Farm_Locations_NC1.csv") 

#Selecting the required columns
HogFarm_Locations <- HogFarm_Locations %>%
  select(title, latitude, longitude) %>%
   na.omit(HogFarm_Locations)
  
#Converting the dataframe to a sf (spatial features) dataframe
HogFarm_Locations_sf <- HogFarm_Locations %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c('longitude', 'latitude'),
           crs = 4269)

colnames(HogFarm_Locations_sf)

## Scripts and code

## Quality assurance/quality control
> We sourced our data from reputible sources such as Google Maps, the Environmental_Data_Analytics_2022 GitHub, and the North Carolina Institute of Medicine. It should be noted that some existing hog farms are not within the Google Maps database and as such were not included within the spatial analysis. To ensure high quality of consistancy in our data, we kept organized unwrangled data in a Raw folder, dataframes we had wrangled and saved in a Processed folder, and any data used with spatial analysis into a Spatial folder. We renamed our data files using names that would provide users a general idea of what the data contained. We never wrangled or edited the Raw data files, and agreed to only save wrangled data that would be used widely in our analyses. All our data and project files were saved and backed up to our GitHub repository which we pulled from at the beginning of each session, and pushed to at the end of each session.
